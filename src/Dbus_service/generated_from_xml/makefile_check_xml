# One extra target (which requires xmllint, from package libxml2-utils)
# is available to verify the well-formedness and the structure of the
# interface definition xml file.
#
# Use the 'checkxml' target to run the interface XML through xmllint
# verification. You'll need to be connected to the Internet in order
# for xmllint to retrieve the DTD from fd.o (unless you setup local
# catalogs, which are not covered here).

# Interface XML name (used in multiple targets)

# Special target to run DTD validation on the interface XML. Not run
# automatically (since xmllint isn't always available and also needs
# Internet connectivity).
checkxml: $(interface_xml)
	@xmllint --valid --noout $<
	@echo $< checks out ok
